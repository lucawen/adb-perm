# ADB-PERM

Add the required permissions of all applications installed on your device.

#### Why?
When i disabled the "MIUI Features" from my phone, all permissions of all applications have been reseted. So i make this script to re-enable this permissions so i dont need to go in every app settings and enable then.


### Documentation
You need to have adb and aapt installed in your system to this work.

Connect you device to you system and enable usb debugging mode.

All prompts will be made on script.

```sh
python main.py
```
